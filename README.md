# Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) â€” Console Edition Â· v0.1.0

This is the first public release of my Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) project.  
Itâ€™s a **C# .NET console application** with:

- Rule-checked **piece movement validation**
- Turn-based **Red vs Black**
- **Online multiplayer** via a simple **clientâ€“server** model using `System.Net.Sockets`
- Text (ASCII) board rendering in the terminal

> Newer versions evolve into a desktop GUI and a web app, but this repo preserves the original console experience.
